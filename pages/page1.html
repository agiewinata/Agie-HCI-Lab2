    <h2 id="overview">Overview:</h2>    
    <p>Bandung is the capital city of the West Java province of Indonesia. 
        Located on the island of Java, the city is the third largest city in Indonesia 
        and Greater Bandung (Bandung Basin Metropolitan Area / BBMA) is the country's 
        second-largest and second most populous metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants.
        Situated 768 meters (2,520 feet) above sea level  and the lowest in the South at 675 meters 
        above sea level, approximately 135 kilometres (84 miles) southeast of Jakarta, 
        \Bandung has cooler year-round temperatures than most other Indonesian cities. 
        The city lies in a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains that provide a 
        natural defense system, which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's 
        plan to move the capital from Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung.</p>

    <h2 id="history">History:</h2>
    <p>The official name of the city during the colonial Dutch East Indies period was Bandoeng. 
        The earliest reference to the area dates back to 1488, although archaeological findings 
        suggest a type of Homo erectus species had long previously lived on the banks of the 
        Cikapundung River and around the old lake of Bandung. During the 17th and 18th 
        centuries, the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) established plantations in the Bandung area.
        In 1786, a supply road connecting Batavia, Bogor, Cianjur, Bandung, Sumedang and Cirebon 
        was constructed. In 1809, Napoleon ordered Governor Herman Willem Daendels to improve the 
        defensive systems of Java to protect against a possible British invasion. Daendels ordered 
        the construction of a road stretching approximately 1,000 km from the west to the 
        east coast of Java, passing through Bandung. In 1810, the road was laid down in Bandung 
        and was named De Groote Postweg, the present-day location of Jalan Asia-Afrika. 
        Under Daendels' orders, R. A. Wiranatakusumah II, the Chief Administrator of the Bandung 
        regency at that time, moved the office from Krapyak, in the south, to a place 
        near a pair of holy city wells, the present-day site of the city square (alun-alun). 
        He built his dalem (palace), masjid agung (the grand mosque) and pendopo (public-official 
        meeting place) in the classical Sundanese orientation,with the pendopo facing Tangkuban 
        Perahu mountain, which was believed to have a mystical ambience. In 1856, Bandung also 
        became the capital of the Preanger Regencies Residency, which it would remain until 1925.</p>

        Significant tourist sites near Bandung include the Tangkuban Prahu volcano crater to the 
        north, the Kawah Putih volcano lake, and Patenggang Lake, a lake surrounded by tea 
        plantations about 50 kilometres the south of the city. To view the Bandung 
        Basin clearly in its mountain surroundings, visitors travel to the Bongkor protected forest 
        area (kawasan hutan lindung), Saung Daweung and Arcamanik; to the slopes of West Manglayang 
        Mountain in an area known as Caringin Tilu, with entry from Padasuka and Cicaheum to the 
        north. The forest is located in 1,500 metres above sea level and is covered 
        with pine trees managed by a government corporation Perhutani and can be accessed with 
        30 minutes drive from downtown.Visitors going to the north of the city also find 
        Taman Hutan Raya Ir. H. Djuanda. The Cicaheum area also hosts Bukit Moko, a tourist spot 
        famous for its views and its steel statue of a giant star called Puncak Bintang. 
        Bandung has several museums that should be visited by tourists, such as the Geological 
        Museum of Bandung, the Indonesia Postal Museum, Sri Baduga Museum, and the Asian-African 
        Conference Museum.The city government operates Bandros, a tourist bus, since 2014.
